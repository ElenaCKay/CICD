# CI/CD

## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for continuous integration and continuous deployment. It is the automation of the manual human intervention needed to get new code committed into production. This includes:

- Building
- Testing
- Deploying
- Infrastructure provisioning 

The CI/CD pipeline takes code that has changes and automatically tests and pushes it for delivery and deployment. This minimises downtime and helps code to be released faster. As applications become larger CI/CD can decrease development complexity.

**Continuous integration** is the practice of integrating all your code changes into the main branch of a shared source code repository early and often, automatically testing each change when you commit or merge them, and automatically kicking off a build. With continuous integration, errors and security issues can be identified and fixed more easily, and much earlier in the development process.

**Continuous delivery** is a software development practice that works in conjunction with CI to automate the infrastructure provisioning and application release process.

Once code has been tested and built as part of the CI process, CD takes over during the final stages to ensure it's packaged with everything it needs to deploy to any environment at any time. CD can cover everything from provisioning the infrastructure to deploying the application to the testing or production environment.

## Why Jenkins?

Jenkins is an open source continuous integration/continuous delivery and deployment (CI/CD) automation software DevOps tool written in the Java programming language. It is used to implement CI/CD workflows, called pipelines.
